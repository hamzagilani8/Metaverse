    <h1>Assignment 39</h1>
    <p>Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object
        describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
        album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of
        information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
        albums. Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the
        album information correctly.
        Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the
        number of tracks on an album. If the calling line includes a value for the number
        of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object. Make at least one new
        function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.</p>
