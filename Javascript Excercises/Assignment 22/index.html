    <h1>Assignment 22</h1>
    <p>Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
        describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
        should look something like this:
        
        let car = 'subaru';
        
        console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
        
        console.log(car == 'subaru')
        
        • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
        
        • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.</p>
