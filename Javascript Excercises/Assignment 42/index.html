    <h1>Assignment 42</h1>
    <p>Unchanged Magicians: Start with your work from Exercise 41. Call the
        function make_great() with a copy of the array of magicians’ names. Because the
        original array will be unchanged, return the new array and store it in a separate array.
        Call show_magicians() with each array to show that you have one array of the original
        names and one array with the Great added to each magician’s name.</p>
