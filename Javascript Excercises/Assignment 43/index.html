    <h1>Assignment 43</h1>
    <p>Sandwiches: Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants
        on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many
        items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich
        that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number
        of arguments each time.</p>
