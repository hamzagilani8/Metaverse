    <h1>Assignment 31</h1>
    <p>Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.

        • Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.
        
        • Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.
        
        • Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a
        new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.
        
        • Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.</p>
