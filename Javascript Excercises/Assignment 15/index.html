    <h1>Assignment 15</h1>
    <p>More Guests: You just found a bigger dinner table, so now more space is
        available. Think of three more guests to invite to dinner.
        
        • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement to the end of your program informing people that you found a
        bigger dinner table.
        
        • Add one new guest to the beginning of your array.
        
        • Add one new guest to the middle of your array.
        • Use append() to add one new guest to the end of your list.
        • Print a new set of invitation messages, one for each person in your list.
