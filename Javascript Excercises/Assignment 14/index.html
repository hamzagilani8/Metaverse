    <h1>Assignment 14</h1>
    <p>Changing Guest List: You just heard that one of your guests can’t make the
        dinner, so you need to send out a new set of invitations. You’ll have to think of
        someone else to invite.
        
        • Start with your program from Exercise 13. Add a print statement at the
        end of your program stating the name of the guest who can’t make it.
        
        • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with
        the name of the new person you are inviting.
        
        • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still
        in your list.</p>
