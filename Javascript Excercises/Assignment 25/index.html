        Alien Colors #2: Choose a color for an alien as you did in Exercise 25, and
        write an if-else chain.
        
        • If the alien’s color is green, print a statement that the player just earned 5 points for shooting the alien.
        
        • If the alien’s color isn’t green, print a statement that the player just earned 10 points.
