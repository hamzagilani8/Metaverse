    <h1>Assignment 41</h1>
    <p>Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 40.
        Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
        the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
        see that the list has actually been modified.</p>
