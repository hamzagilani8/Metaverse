    <h1>Assignment 44</h1>
    <p>Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object.
        The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It
        should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function
        with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a
        color or an optional feature. 
        Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was
        stored correctly.</p>
